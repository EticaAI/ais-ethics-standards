## Science fiction

The following references have a very limited application as practical standards
and, therefore, are classified here as **science fiction**. They are explicitly
listed because they are popular and as a way to encourage people to understand
that there is a difference between them and others.

TL;DR: **do not use these references for non-fiction**, or at least educate the
audience of it's limitations.

| Region | Topic | Organization | Link |

| _"Science fiction"_ | Roboethics | [Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov) | [Three Laws of Robotics (Asimov's Laws)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics) |
| _"Science fiction"_ | Roboethics | [Osamu Tezuka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osamu_Tezuka) | Ten Principles of Robot Law / Astro Boy series |

# Footnotes

- <b id="f1">1</b>: These treaties are followed by
[Member states of the United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations) (e.g near
_all_ territories), but some articles of each document may have minor objections.
See [Multilateral Treaties Deposited with the Secretary-General](https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ParticipationStatus.aspx?clang=_en)
for full details.

- <b id="f2">2</b> See [reservations on Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women](https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&mtdsg_no=IV-8&chapter=4&clang=_en) [↩](#a2)

- <b id="f3">3</b>: Except for non-official copies or non-official
translations from the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights created on 1990, there
are no official links do download and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation
does cite it's endorsement from this very specific document, but has references
like the [Statute of the OIC Women Development Organization](http://ww1.oic-oci.org/english/convenion/Statue_of_the_oic_women_development_org_en.pdf).
The Human Rights documents from United Nations with (if any) minor objections
seems to be a more reliable source in 2019, even for state members of OIC.
